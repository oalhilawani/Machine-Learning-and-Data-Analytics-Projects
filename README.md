Project 1: Applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision trees model on various datasets.
Project 2: Developed and implemented an anomaly detection algorithm utilizing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
Project 3: Applied principle component analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to determine the number of principal components needed to capture 95% of the dataset's variance thus enhancing the modelâ€™s efficiency.
Project 4: Implemented Full-Batch and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent on datasets, examining the training efficiency and accuracy of the model using various batch-sizes and learning rates to analyze convergence behavior.
